Hey there,

You are looking at some sort of lil representation of my current progress in the field of machine learning. When I'm done whith certein part or find time to fully train the model (as it seems my machine isn't quite suitable for the high computational task) I usually try to upload the results at some form. I'm just at the beginning of my journey, so this is more of a work in progress than something final. Feel free to take a look.

## Projects:
### License Plate Tracker [[Link to the .ipynb file](Projects/breast_histopathology/breast_histopathology_shortened.ipynb)]
- classification of cancerous vs. non-cancerous images 
- Tags (YOLOv8, fine-tuning of the coco-model, ocr of license plates)
- *the following gives a good baseline licence plate tracking model, but it needs some improvemetnt:*
  - *transfer learning on a larger license plate dataset for better object detection*
  - *using a custom OCR model which was trained on regional license plates as `easyocr` struggles with the continuous classification of characters in this sample footage*
